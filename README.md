//  A convenient folder where I have begun some projects to do in my spare time.
//  Sweets project:
    - A vending machine app for depositing snacks.
    - Date period : Feb 2024 - present.
    - I wanted to test out my current coding approach when writing a program.
    - Went with basic OOP and other coding concepts I had learned a while ago in Uni.
    - To prove to myself that I am able to put the knowledge into practice.
